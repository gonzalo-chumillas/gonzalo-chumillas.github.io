title: Three tips to make robut APIs [EN]
---

You can't even imagine how important it is to have a good API. A bad API could delay or even make it impossible to develop any client-side application. That is, a good API will make your front-end developers happy and productive.

Here are three tips for making robust APIs.

## Be brief and specific

Nobody wants "everything". Most of the time, clients only demand specific information from specific topics. And that means **delivering brief and specific data**.

## Be predictable

Let's be honest. A "client-side" application is not a "clever-side" application. For every request (`[METHOD] /path/to/doc`) the client expects the same type of document. Otherwise, the client could be prone to errors.

## Be clear

Don't do it for you, do it for The Human Race.
