title: Three tips to make robut APIs [EN]
---

You can't even imagine how important is to have a good API. A bad API could delay or even make it impossible the to develop of a client-side application. That's why I'm going to talk about three imporant tips to keep in mind while developing an API.

## Be brief and specific

Nobody wants "everything". Most of the time, clients only demand specific information from a specific topic. And that usually means to deliver brief and specific information.

## Be predictable

Let's be honest. A "client-side" application is not a "clever-side" application. Typically it consists of a lot of code that analyzes the information provided by the API and presents it into different interfaces. So don't confuse it by delivering "unpredictable" information.

## Be clear

Please be clear. Don't do it for you, do it for The Human Race.
