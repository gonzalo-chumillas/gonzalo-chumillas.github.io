MoViCon, a framework inspired in the Model-View-Controller design pattern. It represents the result of many years developing RESTful applications in PHP and MySQL.

It was based on the following principles:

  1. **Fast**: It's fast because it uses simple and efficient algorithms.
  2. **Light**: It's light because it occupies 104kB of disk space.
  3. **Soft**:  It's "soft" because it only requires MySQL and PHP5.6 or later.

Enjoy it ;)
