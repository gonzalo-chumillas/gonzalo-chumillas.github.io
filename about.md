I could say that I started programming at school. I still remember my first 38-step programmable scientific calculator. My favorite hobby was trying to program algorithms in its limited memory. Even though I finally decided to study Mathematics, I have always dedicated myself to the programming world. And currently I develop web applications, mainly in PHP, Angular, jQuery and the rest of technologies related to the web.

And, why not? If you need my help to configure a Linux server, install a specific software, register a domain, create a web application, a Python command line utility or simply need technical assistane... do not hesitate to contact to me. You can send me an email to [gonzalo.chumillas@gmail.com](mailto:gonzalo.chumillas@gmail.com).

You can find more information about my experience and work in my [GitHub](https://github.com/gchumillas) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalo-chumillas-5303b5163/) accounts.
